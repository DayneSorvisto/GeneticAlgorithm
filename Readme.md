The weasel program or Dawkins' weasel is a thought experiment and a variety of computer simulations illustrating it.
Their aim is to demonstrate that the process that drives evolutionary systems—random variation combined with 
non-random cumulative selection—is different from pure chance.

We've applied this Weasel program to a turing tarpet programming language to evolve code in the simplest possible way.

Can you really generate code this way?

Yes, but it takes a long time.
